This is an adapter for putting a ThinkPad TrackPoint onto the rad1o joystick.

I printed it with FlexABS (Shore 45D) and 49 pieces in one go to gain more precision (forced layer cooling). On each print, I gained about 80% properly printed adapters, while the rest was unusable, which is okay I guess.

You can also use the adapters without a ThinkPad TrackPoint attached for easier usage.
